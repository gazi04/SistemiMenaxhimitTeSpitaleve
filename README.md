# Hospital Management System üè•

This project is a web-based Hospital Management System (SMS) designed to optimize and automate administrative and clinical processes within a hospital environment. Developed as a technical report for the subject "SEW" (Software Engineering and Web Design) at the "Kadri Zeka" Public University in Gjilan, the system aims to improve efficiency, security, and data management for all stakeholders.

## Core Features üí´

The system is built around a role-based structure, providing personalized access and functionality for different users. Key features include:

- **Role-Based Access Control:** The system distinguishes between roles for administrators, doctors, nurses, laboratory technologists, receptionists, and patients, ensuring secure and relevant access to data.
    
- **Patient Data Management:** It provides a centralized platform for managing patient records, appointment scheduling, and communication.
    
- **Laboratory Analysis Tracking:** The system allows for the tracking of laboratory tests, with automated email notifications sent to patients upon the completion of their results.
    
- **Medication Inventory Management:** It helps in tracking and managing the quantity of medications available in the hospital.
    
- **Reporting and Analysis:** The system generates reports and analyses to assist the administration and other staff in making informed decisions.
    

## Technology Stack üíª

The technical report details the use of various technologies to build this robust system, including:

- **Frontend:** The user interface is developed using modern web technologies to ensure a responsive and user-friendly experience.
    
- **Backend:** The server-side logic handles data processing and security, supporting the various functionalities of the system.
    
- **Database:** A secure and efficient database system is used to store all patient information, medical records, and other critical data.
